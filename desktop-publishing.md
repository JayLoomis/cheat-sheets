# Desktop Publishing Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet is not about a particular technology so much as it's about
design and layout information that applies broadly to desktop publishing.

As I write this, I can feel how I am aging myself: do people even say desktop
publishing anymore? The term feels a bit dated. It comes from a time when
graphic designers and layout professionals were using speicalized tools and
machines or expensive workstations/minicomputers to do typography. These days
typography is a "desktop" task by default (if not a laptop task).

## Points and inches

The defacto official measurement system for page layout and typography is
_points_, which can seem pretty arcane at first. Even after you know how they
work, its easy to forget the specifics if you don't use them all the time.

### Points basics

Modern points (called desktop publishing points or DTP points) were defined in
the 1980s. Despite there being a rich history of different definitions of a
point (it being generally used as a printing measurement for a long time), the
DTP point has become almost universally standardized. The basis of the point is
an inch, and the resolution of the original Macintosh computer screen (this is
also where the rule of thumb that 72 pixels equals an inch on a computer screen
comes from).

Here are some handy values:

| Points | Measurement         |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| 72     | 1"                  |
| 36     | 1/2"                |
| 18     | 1/4"                |
| 9      | 1/8"                |
| 792    | 11" (letter height) |
| 396    | 5.5" (half-height)  |
| 612    | 8.5" (letter width) |
| 306    | 4.25" (half-width)  |
